Subject: [PATCH 22/29] busybox: compile with debug information

The added debug information is stripped of during packaging, so it does not
increase the package size. It does however slightly change offsets in the
code, preventing the weird ash segfaults we've been seeing. Also, if the
issue returns, we'll have debug information matching the coredumps.
